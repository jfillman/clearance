"""The Hangar pack: the policy for Glidepath and Airframe tools.

Policy only. Which glidepath.* and airframe.* tools exist, their tiers and arguments, and the rules
about them are Clearance's (D16): R021 Glidepath's cicd.yaml scope on any file-writing tool, R022 and
R023 the per-agent app allowlists (profile.glidepath.apps, profile.airframe.apps). What the tools do
is Autopilot's: its handlers call glidepath-api and Airframe (autopilot.gateway).
