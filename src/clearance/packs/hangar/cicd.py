"""Glidepath's cicd.yaml scope (GP-SCOPE-001/002/003) on every changed cicd.yaml: the check behind R021.

An agent may change cicd.yaml in a pull request, but only field by field, under Glidepath's own rules.
The rules and the code that reads them are Glidepath's, vendored (vendor/), so the decision here is the
one the pull request's own `glidepath validate --agent` check would give.
